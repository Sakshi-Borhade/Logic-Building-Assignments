Program: Print Even Numbers

Description:
This program accepts one number from the user and prints that many even numbers on the screen.
 It helps demonstrate basic user input handling and output of a sequence of even numbers.

How It Works:
1. The program asks the user to enter a number (N).
2. It then prints the first N even numbers starting from 0 in sequence.

Example:

Input:
Enter a number: 5

Output:
0
2
4
6
8

Instructions:

- Input a non-negative integer when prompted.
- The program will print the count of even numbers corresponding to the input.
- Make sure input is a valid number to see correct results.

Notes:
- Even numbers start from zero and increase by 2 each time.
- The program does not print negative even numbers.
- Handling invalid input depends on program implementation.

This description is language-agnostic and can be implemented in any programming language or environment that 
supports user input and printing output.
